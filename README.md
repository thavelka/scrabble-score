# Scrabble Score
Simple Scrabble Scoring App

This is a one-day app I made to practice some things that I've learned, as well as fulfill a need. My girlfriend and I attempted to play Scrabble with no pen, and I was disappointed with other apps on the market. Really I was finding an excuse to make another app, but this one served a purpose.

This is also the first app I've made with 100% original code.
I will not be continuing development, as this was only meant to be a quick personal challenge.

The Activity code is a complete mess, but considering this is my very first app, I'll be leaving it like that so I can come back and see how much I've improved.

Features:
* Players can add the names of two players, shown at the top of the main screen.
* Scores can be incremented or decremented by one or five at a time.
* Scores can be reset with a simple tap of the New Game button. 
* Awesome artwork made by me.

By making this app, I've learned how to...
* create scalable, portable Java classes that can be used on any platform.
* integrate said class into an Android project.
* create an icon and artwork using Photoshop, then use them as resources.
* create and destroy views.
* grab text from a TextEdit and use it somewhere else.
* figure things out on my own.
